# Scenario: PO Skill Assessment – Calendar Visualization Dashboard

## Description

This scenario is part of a virtual skill assessment for the Product Owner (PO) role.  
It is designed to simulate a realistic team meeting covering the early phases of a product’s development.  
The product being discussed is a Google Calendar–based workload visualization tool, described in `product_briefs/calendar_dashboard.md`.

The purpose is to evaluate the participant’s ability to:

- Understand and clarify product context and stakeholder expectations
- Structure product vision, user problems, and feature priorities
- Lead the team through Sprint Planning by forming a logical, collaborative plan

## Scope

This scenario consists of a **single roleplay session** covering:

1. **Onboarding** – context setting by team members (SM-led)
2. **Sprint 0** – vision alignment and user problem discussion (SM-facilitated)
3. **Sprint Planning** – prioritization of the initial backlog (PO-led)

All of these take place within one continuous meeting, facilitated by the Scrum Master.
